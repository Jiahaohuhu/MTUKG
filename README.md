# A Hierarchically Structured Urban Knowledge Graph Dataset for Multi-Level Spatial Tasks

## 1. Overview

![FZ](fz.png)

HUSK is a hierarchically structured urban knowledge graph dataset designed for multi-level spatial tasks. It covers entities such as POIs, roads, and regions in New York City and Chicago, and introduces "Functional Zones" as an intermediate layer to bridge micro-level POIs and macro-level administrative areas. The figure above illustrates how the added functional zones are reflected within areas. Compared to existing UrbanKG datasets, HUSK captures urban semantics and spatial relationships at a finer granularity, enabling a wide range of tasks such as crime prediction, taxi demand forecasting, and new store recommendation, with significant performance improvements across multiple benchmark models.

## 2. Installation
You can create and activate the environment required to run the project using the following commands.

```
conda create -n python3.7 HUSK
conda activate HUSK
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please ensure that you have cloned the project and entered the directory before running the above commands.

## 3. Dataset

The datasets used in this work are derived from two open-source datasets in the UUKG project, collected from New York and Chicago. The complete data sources can be found on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10f3euFFKJttW-_TwR61hakEPpAJypio7?usp=sharing), respectively.

Below are detailed explanations of how to preprocess and use these data.

#### 3.1 HUSK Data

##### 3.1.1 Data Overview

The following table provides a brief description of the dataset:

| Dataset | POI   | Road   | Junction | FZ   | Area | Borough |
| ------- | ----- | ------ | -------- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| NYC     | 62450 | 110919 | 62627    | 1271 | 260  | 5       |
| CHI     | 31573 | 71578  | 37342    | 190  | 77   | 6       |

For each city, we construct its corresponding HUSK, which consists of triples formed by entities and relations. As shown in the table above, entities represent various urban features at different hierarchical levels, while relations serve as edges that connect pairs of entities. The main types of relations include the following:

| relation | description                                            | example                          | count                     |

##### 3.1.2 Guidance on data usage and processing

All raw data is stored in the **'./Meta_data'** folder. You can process these files using the `preprocess_meta_data_nyc.py` or `preprocess_meta_data_chi.py` scripts to perform necessary cleaning and alignment. Once processed, the cleaned data will be saved into the **'./Processed_data'** folder.

Next, you can generate the basic urban knowledge graphs by running the `construct_UrbanKG_XXX.py` script. After that, under the `UrbanKG` directory, both the **'./CHI'** and **'./NYC'** folders contain corresponding scripts for knowledge graph enhancement. You may sequentially run `fz.py`, `add_fz.py`, `add_PLR.py`, and `add_FHPC.py` to build the enhanced HUSK.

In addition, the `fixed_sequence_entity2id_relation2id.py` script assigns unique IDs to entities and relations in the HUSK. Then, `KG_split.py` is used to generate the training, validation, and test sets required for downstream POI-level tasks.

The file information in each directory is as follows:

```
./Meta_data    Raw data set: administrative division data, POI and road network data
./Processed_data   Preprocessed data and clustering results of Functional Zones
./UrbanKG    Various versions of HUSK, containing multiple types of entities and diverse relations
```

The following types of atomic files are defined:

| filename                              | content                                 | example                       |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| entity2id_XXX.txt                     | entity_name, entity_id                  | FZ/1256 237542                |
| relation2id_XXX.txt                   | relation_name, relation_id              | PLR 13                        |
| train                                 | entity_id, relation_id, entity_id       | 187868	12	236285        |
| valid                                 | entity_id, relation_id, entity_id       | 19586	10	236262         |
| test                                  | entity_id, relation_id, entity_id       | 137618	5	140317         |
| triplet.txt                           | entity_id, relation_id, entity_id       | 48034   12 168303             |
| UrbanKG_XXX.txt                       | entity_name, relation_name, entity_name | POI/442 PLA Area/13           |
| UrbanKG_XXX_PLR_withFZ_FHPC.txt       | entity_name, relation_name, entity_name | FZ/707 FHPC PC/parking_area   |
| cluster_result_alpha0.50_beta0.50.csv | functional_zone_id, area_id, poi_ids    | 7,211,"418980,621514,1074344" |

#### 3.2 Urban Spatial Task Data

| Type | Urban Spatial flow prediction | Urban Spatial event prediction |
| ------- | -------  | ------ |
| Dataset  | taxi, bike, human Mobility | crime, 311 service |
| Sensor | region-level, road-level, POI-level | region-level |

##### Guidance on data usage and processing

All raw data is stored in the **'./Meta_data'** folder. You can process these files using the `preprocess_meta_data_nyc.py` or `preprocess_meta_data_chi.py` scripts to perform necessary cleaning and alignment. Once processed, the cleaned data will be saved into the **'./Processed_data'** folder.

Next, run the construct_USTP_Pointflow_XXX.py script to generate a dataset for spatio-temporal flow prediction, or use the construct_USTP_Event_XXX.py script to build a dataset for urban event prediction.

We storage them in the  **'./Urban_Spatial_Task'** directory.

The file information in each directory is as follows:

```
./Meta_data    Raw data set: taxi, bike, crime and 311 service event data.
./Processed_data   Aligned datasets: taxi, bike, human, crime and 311 service spatiotemporal dataset which are aligned with area, road and POI.
./Urban_Spatial_Task    The reformatted USTP dataset is now ready for use with downstream USTP models. 
```

## 4. How to Run

#### 4.1 Structure-aware UrbanKG Embedding

To train and evaluate a HUSK embedding model for the POI-level tasks, use the run.py script:

```bash
python ./UrbanKG_Embedding_Model/run.py 
			 [-h] [--dataset {NYC, CHI}]
              [--model {TransE, RotH, ...}]
              [--regularizer {N3,N2}] [--reg REG]
              [--optimizer {Adagrad,Adam,SGD,SparseAdam,RSGD,RAdam}]
              [--max_epochs MAX_EPOCHS] [--patience PATIENCE] [--valid VALID]
              [--rank RANK] [--batch_size BATCH_SIZE]
              [--neg_sample_size NEG_SAMPLE_SIZE] [--dropout DROPOUT]
              [--init_size INIT_SIZE] [--learning_rate LEARNING_RATE]
              [--gamma GAMMA] [--bias {constant,learn,none}]
              [--dtype {single,double}] [--double_neg] [--debug] [--multi_c]

```
**How to get the embedding?**

We establish an index mapping between entities and their learned embeddings, which is stored in **`./data/entity_idx_embedding.csv`**. To obtain the learned UrbanKG embeddings, run **`id2id.py`** followed by **`get_embedding.py`**. The resulting embeddings will be saved in the **`./embedding`** folder in `.npy` format.

#### 4.2 Knowledge-enhanced Urban Spatial Task

To train and evaluate models with HUSK-enhanced embeddings, use the `run.py` script.

```bash
python ./Urban_Spatial_Task_Model/run.py --task traffic_state_pred --model STPGCN --dataset CHICrime20210112
```
This script will run the STPGCN model on the CHICrime20210112 dataset for traffic state prediction task under the default configuration.

**How to fuse UrbanKG embedding?**

To fuse UrbanKG embedding, we directly concatenate the embedding with USTP feature for input. You can mannualy modify it in the **./data/dataset/traffic_state_dataset.py**.

You can find more information about the models in the **"readme.md"** files located in the specific directories of our project.
